    "###### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a program that calculates the Manhattan Distance of a given number of elements from two centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Included:\n",
    "\n",
    "User-Interface Program : \n",
    "\n",
    "Completing the manhattan distance calculations. This enables users to interact with the program. However a key takeaway from this project for other python enthusiasts & coders should be not the mathematics involved within the manhattan distance but more so an in depth look at collection type properties and distinguishing which is the best fit for the tasks within this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "De - Bugging :\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involved breaking down the code into small segements for both detetcing bugs and solving tasks required to build this program. This is a good approach for fellow pythonists in developing programs and building skills behind the scenes to succesfully complete such programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Project Information \n",
    "\n",
    "This program was designed as a subtask of an ongoing project, which is the development of the unsupervised K - Means Clustering Algorithim from scratch ! \n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for delving into the internals mechanics of the K - Means CLustering Algorithim is simply to gain exposure and experience building algorithims from bottom to top. The aim is to improve & refine skills in python programming which enables such tasks to be succesfully completed to a high standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore this subtask (Manhattan Distance) and more specifically it was a follow on from the previous notebook objectives which manually computed the euclidean distance of a number of elements from two centroid points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of the development of both the euclidean distance & manhattan distance programs is to build a user inter face system enabling user interaction with the K - Means Clustering Algorithim and specifically enabling the user choice between using either the euclidean or manhattan distance metric. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit Learn watch out !!\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Manhattan Distance Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan Distance also known as the city block distance or taxi distance formula is equivalent to a Minkowsky distance with P = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan Distance is the distance measured along axes at right angles !\n",
    "\n",
    "There are subtle differences within the calculations utilized to find the Euclidean Distance. The rationale for these subtle differences would be best left to be explained by mathmaticians or other experienced experts within the field of computer science, mathematics or related fields.\n",
