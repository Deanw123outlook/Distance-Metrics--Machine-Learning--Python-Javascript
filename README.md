Euclidean-Distamce-Metric
This program was designed as a subtask of an ongoing project which is the development of the unsupervised K - Means Clustering Algorithim using PYTHON.
This sub task (Euclidean Distance Project) enables python enthusiasts to get into the internal working of lists and insight into other data collection types.
A key takeaway from this project is that when CONVERTING lists into dictionaries, repeated keys will be removed automatically. This posed an issue moving forward with the mathematical calculations in the specific sequence required in the concluding sections of the program. The solution was initiating a for loop and zipping lists together whilst iterating throughout the elements within the lists in the sequence required required for specific calculations (see line 80).
Furthermore, I have developed the same euclidean distance program using Javascript which prooves very useful for comparing both Python & Javascript programming languages on many different levels.
Coders you wont be disappointed !
